PROBLEM:

Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the names of all the continents (COUNTRY.Continent) and their respective average city populations (CITY.Population) rounded down to the nearest integer.

Note: CITY.CountryCode and COUNTRY.Code are matching key columns.

SOLUTION:

SELECT o.CONTINENT, FLOOR(AVG(i.POPULATION)) 
FROM CITY AS i JOIN COUNTRY AS o ON i.COUNTRYCODE=o.CODE 
GROUP BY o.CONTINENT;
