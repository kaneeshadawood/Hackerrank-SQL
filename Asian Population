PROBLEM:

Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the sum of the populations of all cities where the CONTINENT is 'Asia'.

Note: CITY.CountryCode and COUNTRY.Code are matching key columns.

OUTPUT:

SELECT SUM(i.POPULATION) 
FROM CITY AS i JOIN COUNTRY AS o ON i.COUNTRYCODE=o.CODE 
WHERE o.CONTINENT='Asia';
